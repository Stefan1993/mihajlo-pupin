           <P> Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", followed closely on the <br>pioneering work of the English physicist and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which predates<br> Pupin's patent by some seven years. The importance of the patent was made clear when the <br>American rights to it were acquired by American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T),<br> making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they<br> already had their own development in hand led by George Campbell and had up to this point<br> been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent. <br>AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable due<br> to its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.</P>
